## 1. Project Motivation
 The National Earthquake Information Center now locates about *20,000 earthquakes* around the globe each year, or approximately *55 per day*.
 Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air and wreak destruction across entire cities.
 Although we can't sense most of them, it is important to model these earthquakes to improve our insights in the field of detection. 
## 2. Objectives
*   Obtain the dataset and prepare the data for Statistical Modeling
*   Fit Beta Distribution to the random sample 
## 3. Methods Used
* Feature Engineering
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
## 4. Installation
* Python versions 3.*.
* Python Libraries:
    * Pandas
    * Numpy
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
    * Scipy
## 5. Data
The data utilized for the project is obtained from **U.S. Geological Survey Department** which monitors seismic activites through out the globe. These input data files are ***Earthquake.csv*** which is uploaded to the repository. This file contains earthquakes of magnitude 6.0+ ranging from 1/4/1900 to 3/17/2014
## 6. Implementation
In this project I have used ***Beta Distribution*** to fit the data samples. I've chosen about ***1000 samples*** from the dataset.
## 7. Results
The Beta Distribution has been fit to the data and  visually compared with the random variable.
